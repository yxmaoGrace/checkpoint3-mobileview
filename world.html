		<h2>Salsas</h2>
			<h3><span>Origin:</span> Mexico</h3>
			<h3><span>Type of food:</span> Condiment</h3>
			<h3><span>Spicy ingredient:</span> many types of chilies, including Jalapenos.</h3>
			<h3><span>Fun fact:</span> Mexico’s biggest spicy export and its favorite condiment, salsas are a world unto themselves. </h3>
		<p>The varieties are endless, but the base of chillies, fresh herbs, and red or green tomatoes is ubiquitous. 
			While visitors to Mexico wanted to nail down a guideline as to which salsa is hotter, red or green, 
			any seasoned taco-eater will tell you that either could be blazing hot or surprisingly mild. 
			While the creamy avocado green sauce served at many taco stands tends to be a little less intense, 
			it could easily blow your socks off. Often, salsa with chile de árbol or habanero peppers will be extra-hot.</p>

			<h3><span>Origin:</span> Thailand</h3>
			<h3><span>Type of food:</span> Soup</h3>
			<h3><span>Spicy ingredient:</span> Crushed chilli peppers.</h3>
			<h3><span>Fun fact:</span> It’s one of the most popular Thai dishes across the globe.</h3>
		<p>Although this hot and sour shrimp soup originates from Central Thailand, 
			it can also be found in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore or Laos. 
			If you’re looking for a partner to follow this spicy soup, make sure you team it up 
			with a pad thai or pad see ew (a mild noodle dish if you can’t handle the heat).</p>

			If you’re looking for a unique gastronomy jaunt, South Korea should be next on your go-to list.
