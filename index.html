		<p>Hi Everyone! This is Yixuan, a loyal spicy lover since early childhood. 
			Growing up in Lanzhou, China, a city in northwestern China with a 
			population of different ethnicities, I got the chance to taste food 
			with diverse flavors. With all kinds of food using different spices, 
			ingredients, and cooking methods, my all time favorite flavor is SPICINESS.</p>
			<img src = "images/familymeal.jpg" alt = "I like having meals with my family as a young girl." width="200"/>

		<p>For me, spiciness is a strong, pungent flavor that always brings excitement 
			and comfort. It is a flavor that stimulates my taste buds and makes any 
			meal less insipid and boring. Adding a little spoon of pepper oil, 
			or adding several slices of peppers into a dish expands the layers of flavor 
			of that dish, which offers a chance of being surprised with an extra excitement 
			while enjoying a meal. Moreover, spicy food accompanied me through many 
			low-spirited days by warming up my mouth and stomach. The strong 
			flavor of spiciness can help me to relax for a moment and gather myself 
			together to move forward.</p>
